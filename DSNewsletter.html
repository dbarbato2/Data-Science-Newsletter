                                        The team has been busy examining the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) data purchased from data aggregator Attom early in 2020 to see what elements might
                                        be able to help us further our pricing and underwriting segmentation. While the data has anticipated uses ranging from pre-fill to proactively monitoring
                                        one's book of business for any properties going on the market, it turns out there may be other insights to be found. Working with Product Operations,
                                        <a href="mailto:tanner.kulbashian@homesite.com">Tanner Kulbashian</a> was able to dig into the data to try and identify pockets of Homesite business linked
                                        to the MLS data that was particularly unprofitable. By using classification techniques, there were 2 distinct groups identified. The first is a larger set of
                                        properties where the home was either recently sold under a short sale or was real estate owned (REO) when sold. While this cohort makes up a small percentage
                                        of homes sold on the market, average loss ratios range between 10 and 20 points above the average Homesite risk. The second cohort is a much smaller but even
                                        riskier group of properties. These include homes where the recent sale price was below $30K as well as those whose sale price was less than halved since the
                                        previous time they sold. Due to the relatively smaller size of this cohort and the fact that they are experiencing loss ratios exceeding 50 points above the average risk,
                                        investigations are underway to determine how the business can be declined going forward. Over time all of these fields will be tested and incorporated into multivariate
                                        models such as our inspection and QUEST underwriting models, but we look forward to addressing these risks and leveraging this important data as soon as possible.

                                        Part of American Family’s Property Pricing Development team’s responsibility is to deliver modeled indications for American Family’s by peril HO3, HO4, and HO6
                                        rating plans. With the restructure fast approaching, we determined that the last efforts of the combined team would focus on Enterprise 1 Platform (E1P).
                                        Following a round of data preparation, we were able to complete an extensive comparison between American Family’s by-peril rating plan and Homesite’s Mosaic plan,
                                        which is the base for E1P. What are some of the key differences we found? First, the peril structure between the two plans is somewhat different. For example,
                                        American Family had not yet modeled Lightning as its own separate peril prior to this exercise. We also created variables to mimic Homesite’s claim rating for
                                        historical property and auto claims which are easier to use from a modeling standpoint. We adjusted dwelling information to match, removing percent of basement
                                        finished in favor of square footage. We did retain some variables such as location of washing machine and customer late payments that don’t exist in the current
                                        Homesite plan, but could be added to E1P. We have hope that variables that were not able to be included due to a lack of statistical significance will look better
                                        when we can model on enterprise property data. In the future, the Property COE Data Science group will be able to leverage knowledge and data from across the
                                        enterprise to create rating plans more sophisticated than any one operating company has currently. Reach out to

                                        As part of Homesite's recent migration to Guidewire's ClaimCenter, the Data Science team needed to make sure that the existing claims models identifying
                                        subrogation and fraud likelihood would still continue to function. The end goal, however, was not just functionality but a more complete integration of the
                                        model into the claims system. Toward that end, we wanted to remove model reliance on Homesite-specific predictors that would allow the model to be called from
                                        within ClaimCenter and to be tested on other operating companies data as well. The question was, how do we remove those dozens of predictors and still maintain
                                        accurate predictions? The answer was to use more advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. While these models have always leveraged NLP techniques
                                        to mine the unstructured text found in our claims notes, <a href="mailto:rajat.handa@homesite.com">Rajat Handa</a> stepped it up with use of a state-of-the-art
                                        technique recently open-sourced by Google called BERT. The results were even better than we would have expected and it turns out that with the newer approach, we
                                        can not only maintain the same level of predictive power, but we can actually improve upon it. While he was at it, Rajat experimented with some approaches for
                                        creating a continuous learner, which are AI models that re-train themselves on some defined cadence. Creating models that are continuous learners allow for
                                        improved scalability and increased adaptability to changing patterns in the data. This model will not only improve subrogation predictions but also serve as a
                                        prototype for future models where we can experiment with this approach. With proper monitoring and oversight in place, there is an opportunity to have any of
                                        our non-filed models utilize this cloud-native autonomous learning framework in the future. Please reach out to Rajat or

                                        One of the most important and often overlooked aspects of building predictive models is making sure that they continue to function both effectively and as
                                        expected long after the building and deployment phases are over. We know this is a critical step in the life cycle of a model and have been investing time and
                                        resources into developing a solution that can serve as the foundation for all of our monitoring activities. The team has been hard at work developing repositories
                                        of model scores that update on a daily basis. This means that users can go into standard SQL databases and determine how each model is performing as well as
                                        understand how a model would have scored a particular policy or quote if it had been in production at the time. The retention scores have already been integrated into
                                        regular data feeds to GEICO, prioritizing the risk level on renewing policies and we're exploring several other exciting use cases. Please reach out to
